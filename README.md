FlexSC
======

A Flexible Efficient Secure Computation Backend.

JAVA-8 required

**Looking for more efficient FlexSC? [emp-toolkit](https://github.com/emp-toolkit) is written in C/C++ and supports both malicious and semi-honest 2(M)PC**

version 0.2

1. Runnable backend.
2. Modes(REAL, VERIFY, COUNT, OPT, OFFLINE) that can run the real protocol, verify the correctness of circuit and count the statitics 
of the circuits, halfgate protocols and offline garblging.
3. Basic integer arithmetic circuit library with test case.
4. Fixed point and Floating point arithmetic circuit library with test case.
5. Sorting circuit library with test case. 
6. Libs for Matrix and vectors.
7. RAM support

version 0.3(TODO)

1. optimize some circuit size for Integers, redesign floating point numbers.
2. optimize roundtrip problem
3. develop better tutorial
